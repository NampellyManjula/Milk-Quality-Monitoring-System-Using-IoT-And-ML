# Milk-Quality-Monitoring-System-Using-IoT-And-ML

 Milk Quality Monitoring System Using IoT and ML continuously tracks parameters like temperature, pH,color, taste and fat
 with sensors. Machine learning models are trained by using the dataset and then tested. The quality of milk is displayed on the user interface to know the wheather the milk is good for health or not.

 Sensors used:pH ,Temperature, Color, and lactometer.
 
 Algorithms used:
    1) Logistic Regression-85.2% accuracy.
    2) Random Forest-99.8% accuracy.
    3)Decision Tree Classifier-99.3% accuracy.
    4) K-Nearst-Neighbour(KNN)-99.3% accuracy.
